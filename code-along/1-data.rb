# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 5
puts 2

puts 5 + 2
puts 5*2
puts 5/2
puts 5/2.0

# Non-numbers

puts "Hello, world!"
puts 'Hello, world'

puts "Tacos are" + " delish"

puts "tacos" *3

#puts "tacos" + 3 #can not do that

#puts 3* "tacos" #can not do that

# True, False

puts True
puts False

puts 3 == 2

# Nothing

# Variables

x = 5
y = 2

zebra = 10
giraffe = 3

puts zebra + giraffe

food = "tacos"
quantity = 3

puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables

puts "i want #{quantity} #{food}"



# String manipulation
